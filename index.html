        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h5>As a Computer Science student at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to real-world problems. I have a strong academic background that covers a wide range of topics, such as data structures, algorithms, programming languages, databases, and artificial intelligence.

            Besides my studies, I am actively involved in several tech-related clubs and events, where I collaborate with other enthusiasts and professionals to enhance my skills and knowledge. I am currently leading the Management Team at Linux Club VIT, where I oversee the planning, execution, and evaluation of various workshops, webinars, and competitions. I am also a member of the Operations Team at Enactus VIT Chennai, where I use LinkedIn Talent Insights to identify and connect with potential partners, sponsors, and mentors for our social entrepreneurship projects. 
            
            Through these experiences, I have developed strong communication, analytical, and leadership skills, as well as a keen interest in exploring the intersections of technology, business, and society. I am always eager to take on new challenges and push my boundaries, seeking ways to expand my skill set and stay at the forefront of technology. 
            
            As I progress in my academic journey, I am open to internships, research opportunities, and industry collaborations that can provide real-world exposure and enrich my understanding of the tech industry. I welcome connections with professionals, mentors, and organizations to exchange ideas and insights, fostering a network of continuous learning and growth. Let's connect and embark on this journey of discovery together.
